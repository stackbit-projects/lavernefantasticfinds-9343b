  The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese
  architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings
  see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction
  between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.

Operating a Consignment store during a world wide pandemic is not an easy thing to do. 

Most consignment store shoppers are not used to shopping online.  It's one of  those shopping outings that is an in person experience.  Browsing the racks and shelves and finding that one amazing deal that makes your day.  Finding that item that you didn't leave the house knowing you wanted.  

Today was my first attempt at a FaceBook live video where I am show casing some of the items in the store.  My theory being if my customers can not come to me I will go to them.  

I had 8 people watching as I went through about 15 of my favorite cold weather items.  Hey, it's a start right?  

For most of us trying to stay afloat during a mandatory provincial shutdown doing something is better than doing nothing.  There are at least 18 more days to go until I am able to allow instore shopping and I will do everything I can to keep myself busy.  Coming into the store every day gives me a sense of purpose. 

On my list of things to do over the next few weeks is to really promote my new website and to generate some online sales. 



Now for my FIND OF THE DAY! 

A customer brought in this amazing Care Bear snow globe that is also a music box.  It plays You are my Sunshine.  This is definitely a collectors item and I am positive someone will be just as excited to see it as I was.

Thanks for stopping by.  

Have a super day!!!!
